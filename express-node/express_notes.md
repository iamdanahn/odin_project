# Express.js

## What is Express?
Unopinionated Web framework written in JS for Node.js runtime environment.

Opinionated frameworks have a "right way" to handle any particular tasks. So it is generally well-understood and well-documented on certain methods. This makes them less flexible on solving problems outside their main domain.

Unopinionated frameworks are more "loose" and have fewer restriction on how to piece components together.
Express handles certain situations with middlewares. (there are a LOT)
